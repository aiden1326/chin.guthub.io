               <p>My name is Aiden Chin and I currently attend Botany Downs Secondary College, or also known better as BDSC.
                    I am currently starting my Duke of Edinburgh bronze award. I enjoy playing sport with my family, riding
                    my bike, playing some mobile games, chess, and playing on my laptop. I am currently interested in nature,
                    sea creatures, and shows like The Blue Planet, Shark Tank, and Shameless. I like socialising with people
                    online, and in person. In my life, I have been to a lot of beatiful places and seen a lot of pretty
                    nature things. Some of the places have been to include </p>
               <ul>
                    <li>Melbourne, Gold Coast, Sydney, - Australia</li>
                    <li>Auckland, Rotorua, Taupo, Russel, Bay of Islands, Queenstown, - New Zealand</li>
                    <li>All around Singapore</li>
                    <li> Kaohsiung, Tainan, Taipei, - Taiwan</li>
               </ul>
               <p>
                    Some things that I have accomplished so far is that I gave gotten principals award for a lot of my
                    primary years, I have learnt Chinese, a bit of French and Japanese, I have gotten a lot of good grades,
                    and in my intermediate, I was in a learning extension called "Literacy Plus", which is a extension for
                    people that excelled in one particular subject. A accomplishment in future is that I want to become a pro
                    Badminton player, but if that doesn't work out, I want to be a Surgeon or an Entreprenuer. These are the
                    jobs that I want do because a sport player is fun, a surgeon gets good pay, and an entrepreneuer gets
                    paid a lot of money, and they can pay people to do their jobs/ work for them. Some goals that I want to
                    achieve this year is that I want to pass my exams with merit atleast, I want to win the secondary school
                    badminton tournament with my team, and my last goal that I want to achieve is to pass my black belt
                    taekwondo test with no mistakes, so I can prove to people that I am a black belt in a martial art.
